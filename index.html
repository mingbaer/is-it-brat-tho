        In summer of 2024, singer songwriter Charli XCX launched her iconic album "Brat," with tracks oozing nostalgia for British club kid culture, dancing on tables, and friendships that don't feel the same anymore.  The album heralded a particular aesthetic and attitude, quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon.  When Charli XCX claimed that presidential candidate Kamala Harris was brat, she left many wondering what brat means anyway.
